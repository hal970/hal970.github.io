        <li>Expensive in terms of&#63; Local income&#63; Its financial cycle&#63;  The same can be said for all major cities in the world regardless of region.  It all depends on the currency exchange rate at the time for foreigners.  For the most part, it's as expensive as a tour in New York City, USA.  Or Paris, France.  Or Birmingham, UK. Or Mexico City, Mexico. The list goes on.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Xenophobia stems from the time Japan was an isolationist country and its culture of being wary about foreigners in general.  Once you get past the initial roadbloack, most are nice as anyone else in other major cities.</li>    
        <br>
        <li>Since Japan is an island, locals usually made do with whatever was cheaply available.  The local cuisine mostly is comprised of seafood, but the same can be said about other countries in modern days.</li>
        <br>
        <li>How polite you are shows how "cultured" or "educated" you are in the Japanese social structure.</li>
        <br>
        <li>No comment.  But it's the same for people who obsess over which one is better, Star Wars or Star Trek.</li>
