            <p>Some background to begin with Japan is that while it is much better than before, it is very much still a cash-based economy.</p>
            <p>Cards are generally only used in major cities and within stores, public transportation and some other public/private sectors only accept domestic cards.</p>

            <p>The following data is from Japan's 2015 Census:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Population Census: 127,094,745</li>
            <br>    
            <li>Population Density: 874 people per square mile</li>
            <br>    
            <li>Currency: Japanese Yen</li>
            <br>
            <li>Last Train/Bus Running in Tokyo:  1 AM JST</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>The above is not a typo, contrary to belief, public transport in Japan is NOT 24 hours, and most establishments generally close even earlier at around midnight at the latest barring 24/7 convenience stores.</p>

        <h4>So, just keep in mind the following:</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Have cash handy (and coins).</li>
            <li>Always plan on getting back to where you're staying before 10 PM JST. Just in case.</li>
            <li>It's always going to be crowded, especially popular areas.</li>
            <li>Have a mobile phone that works on Japan's network if you are planning on getting a Data-Only SIM card.</li>
            <li>Wi-Fi rentals to foreigners have to be set up in advance prior to getting into Japan.</li>
            <li>Ditto as above for what's called a "JR Pass", this is "all you can ride on JR owned lines" for free or for discounted prices on bullet trains.</li>
            <li>Always carry ID, passport will do.</li>
            <li>Local places have their own subtle mannerisms.  Study the other Japanese people and follow and (generally) you're be fine.</li> <br>
