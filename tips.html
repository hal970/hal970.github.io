        <h3>Do's and Don'ts</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>There's no tipping in Japan.  In fact, it's taken as an insult if you tip.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Talking on the phone in public transport is huge no-no.  You CAN be kicked off with no second chances.</li>
            <br>    
            <li>Be courteous, and polite.  Even if you don't speak Japanese, body language says alot in Japan.</li>
            <br>    
            <li>Meat is pricey in Japan, they're sold by the gram.</li>
            <br>    
            <li>Convenience stores generally have everything a person can need, from chargers, real food, spare clothing, the list goes on and on.  Very helpful in pinches and budget conscience stays.</li>
            <br>    
            <li>Plan ahead, public transport in Japan are almost always on time to the minute, and one missed connection could cost you.</li>
            <li>If you're travelling around, within, or between major cities all the time the JR Pass is a great investment.</li>
            <br>     
            <li>Cars and people run on the LEFT side of the road, keep this in mind since some placces in Japan do not have sidewalks.</li>
            <br>     
            <li>Vending machines are everywhere in Japan, but generally it's a better idea to buy the drink in bulk within stores and take them on the go from the fridge (of where you're staying).</li>
            <br>     
            <li>Cherry blossom season is from March to the end of April, and generally other tourists will want to travel during this time.</li>
            <br>     
            <li>Japan's rainy season during June to late August, humidity is above the 90s at all time, tempertures also reach the 90s in Fahrenheit and stay that way at night.</li>
